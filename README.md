# SSIS_Multicast_Excel_To_Local_And_AWS_RDS
This project builds an SSIS ETL pipeline that reads and merges data from three Excel files, applies transformations, and loads the final data into a local SQL Server database. Using Multicast, the same processed data is sent in parallel to an AWS RDS (SQL Server) database, demonstrating a hybrid on-premises and cloud data integration workflow.
